# Reading Assignments and Resources **10-40% - Rough Outline** ![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation%20Status-%7E10%25%20Minimal%20Outline-lightgrey?logo=Read%20the%20Docs)

For self-study, I recommend the [**JavaScript.Info**](https://javascript.info/) website; it has a lot of short, high-quality resources that are helpful to give you a *working* understanding of JavaScript. For authoritative information on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, see the **Mozilla Developer Network**'s documentation.

> The reading items marked with a star (**:star:**) are tied to the quizzes for the course.

The following e-books also serve as good supplementary reading resources.

- [**Eloquent JavaScript**](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [**Exploring ES6**](https://exploringjs.com/es6/)
