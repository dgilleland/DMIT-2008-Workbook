# About This Workbook

## ![Version Control](../images/tasks.png) Version Control

At the end of the term, your repositories on this [DMIT-2008 GitHub Organization](https://github.com/DMIT-2008) will be removed. You will still have access to your local versions of these repositories for your personal use and review.

> :warning: **Do *NOT*** re-publish your assignment/assessment repositories - doing so with any materials worth marks is an act of **academic dishonesty**, even if done after completion of your diploma. :warning:

## ![Software et.al.](../images/code.png) Software & Resources

**Required** books, videos, tools, etc. for this course include:

- **Software**
  - [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - This is the beating heart of **Version Control**, something that you will work with every day. Second only to your editor in terms of usage, it's indispensable for managing your development in teams or on your own.
  - [**GitHub CLI**](https://cli.github.com/) (*Command-Line Interface*) - A tool for interacting with your GitHub repository on the command line.
  - [**node**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes **npm**) - Node is a run-time that allows you to use JavaScript on the web server. It comes along with npm (*Node Package Manager*), a package-management tool for the command line that allows you to integrate 3rd-party libraries with your application.
  - [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm) - `pnpm` is a *faster* package manager than using `npm`, and is recommended by your instructor.
  - [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com) (see [Notes](#vs-code-extensions) on VS Code extensions) - This is the preferred editor for working in almost any programming language.
- **Accounts/Services**
  - [**GitHub**](https://github.com) - Core to everything you will do, this service handles cloud hosting of your repositories and so, so much more!
  - [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/) - Hosting platform for your website projects. Ultimately, you will need to know how to publish your projects as part of a *Continuous Integration* and *Continuous Development* (CI/CD) workflow. Suitable for static websites.
  - [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) - Like *Netlify*, *Vercel* offers hosting and CI/CD workflows to aid you in publishing your websites.
  - [**FireBase**](https://firebase.google.com/) - Similar to *Netlify* and *Vercel*, FireBase also offers various features/products to support dynamic websites, including *realtime databases* and *authentication*.
- [**Books/Articles/Videos**](../Readings.md)
